# CI-CD-Pipeline-for-Node.js-Deploying-to-AWS-EC2-with-Docker-and-GitHub-Actions-Docker-project-01
In this project, we will learn how to deploy a Node.js application using GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS EC2. This fully automated pipeline ensures that our application on the EC2 instance is always up-to-date with the latest changes.

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform designed to automate your build, test, and deployment processes. By configuring a .yml file, you can specify tasks to run in response to events like pull requests, issues, or commits.

In this guide, we will utilize GitHub Actions to build a Docker image and push it to Docker Hub. An AWS EC2 instance will serve as a self-hosted runner. The instance will then pull and run the Docker container, allowing us to access the application via its public IP.
